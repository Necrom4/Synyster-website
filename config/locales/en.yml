# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization and
# are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other than
# English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more about the API, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
#
# Be aware that YAML interprets the following case-insensitive strings as
# booleans: `true`, `false`, `on`, `off`, `yes`, `no`. Therefore, these strings
# must be quoted to be interpreted as strings. For example:
#
#     en:
#       "yes": yup
#       enabled: "ON"

    band_description: "Born in an era of overprocessed music and meaningless art, Synyster is a young Heavy Metal band from Switzerland tackling societal issues and everyday emotional struggles to the tune of heavy and out-of-the-norm rhythmic patterns coupled to melodic solos and high-pitched screams, bringing a breath of fresh air to the Swiss Metal scene.<br><br>The five friends first set foot on stage in June 2023 inside their home town's majestic Castle. Soon enough they'd start playing alongside iconic Swiss bands, on the stages they had previously dreamt of.<br>Wanting to keep their classic and beloved Heavy Metal sound while experiencing new musical horizons, they'd start composing fresher, heavier, proggier and more melodically complex music, tunning down their guitars to create harmonies, learning new more radical screaming techniques and only ever finishing a song when it finally told its whole story."
